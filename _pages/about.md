Data science enthusiast who is passionate about transforming data into useful products. A person with 'Agile Mindset'

I am an electrical engineer who identified her true passion for data science. The amazing growth of intelligence in things around intrigued me to think 'how they can work so ?'. This curiosity led me exploring areas of data mining, machine learning, and deep learning. I started teaching myself how these algorithms work !!!

I love creative as well as complex problem solving and programming. Continuous innovation and learning are what attracted me to data science. I am the person who has always been the first one to roll up sleeves if I encounter any data problem.
