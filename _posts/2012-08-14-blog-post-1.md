Model Asset Exchange is the one stop shop for open source deep learning models, covering common application domains, such as audio, image, text or video processing. When you pick a model from MAX, you:
- can be sure that the model code and intellectual property (IP) have been vetted and tested
- can deploy the model as a microservice in minutes
- can consume the model using a simple REST API
Looks fascinating, right? Now, I am going to take you through whatâ€™s happening behind the scenes.

Data science is awesome and machine learning is the wave of the future! Extracting a solution from data to solve a business problem makes you feel like a wizard. But, no one is born a data science wizard. You have all the magical tools around you and all you need is to learn how to use them. The Model Asset eXchange (MAX) is one set of tools that will help significantly in your journey to becoming a data science wizard.
