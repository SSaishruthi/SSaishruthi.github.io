Data science is awesome! However, there's a lot of work that needs to be done before you can automagically make predictions, find unknown patterns, and discover trends in your data. This tutorial will walk you through the entire data science life cycle. We'll start at the end with a look at how developers can easily integrate pre-trained open source deep learning models from the IBM Developer Model Asset Exchange (MAX) into their applications. From here we'll demystify the process of developing, training, and deploying deep learning models using open source technologies and open standards. This tutorial should be of interest to developers and data scientists alike.
