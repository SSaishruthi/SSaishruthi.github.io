Data Science is awesome. Now in all our minds one question will definitely pop up, Why Data Science is awesome?. It is because it automagically lets you predict things and find unknown patterns as well as trends in your data. One of the crucial steps in the data science lifecycle is model development. This can be visualized as your toolbox and all algorithms as tools.Choosing the best tool is crucial as it directly enhance your business decision making. 

In this talk, we will walk you through the life cycle of data science and introduce you IBMâ€™s Model Asset Exchange (MAX).
