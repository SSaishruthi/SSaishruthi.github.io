This workshop will cover all the main steps involved in a Data Science Project: from getting the data and cleaning to the use of different machine learning models (including evaluation and prediction).
We all know that Data Science is not only about Machine Learning Models. Data Scientists spend over 80% of their time cleaning and exploring the data and only 20% doing Machine Learning (source: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html). The workshop will cover data cleaning, data manipulation, exploration and visualization.
